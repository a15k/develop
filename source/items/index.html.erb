<h1>
  Working with Items
</h1>

<p>Make sure to check out the <%= link_to "Tech Overview", "/tech" %> as it has a guide on contributing and accessing items.</p>

<h2>API Versions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><%= link_to "v1.0.0", "/items/v1/api" %></li>
</ul>

<h2>API Keys</h2>

<p>An a15k power user from your organization can access keys for the Items API by logging into a15k.org (or a sandbox version of this site), clicking "Actions" in the upper right corner, clicking "API Access" in the dropdown menu and then accessing the token at the <b>top</b> of that page.  Note that the tokens at the bottom of that page (under the "Interactions" heading) are different; they are for contributing usage data.</p>

<h2>Client Libraries</h2>

<p>a15k provides autogenerated clients for a number of languages, broken down by API version.</p>

<p><b>Don't see a client for your language?</b>  Contact us and we'll autogenerate it.</p>

<% clients = ClientFinder.new("mothership").data %>

<% clients.each do |language, versions| %>

  <h4><%= language %></h4>

  <ul>
    <% versions.each do |version| %>
      <li>
        <%= link_to "v#{version}",
                    "https://github.com/a15k/interactions-api/tree/master/clients/#{version}/#{language}"
        %>
      </li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% end %>
