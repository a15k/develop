title: a15k: Tech Overview
---

<h1>Tech Overview</h1>

<p>a15k has been set up to make accessing and contributing content as easy as possible.  This site provides libraries, API specifications, and walkthroughs to help you be an effective member of the network.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The following list will help you get started with a15k technologies.  We assume that your organization has already contacted the Assessment Network and established a relationship.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contact the a15k tech team to set up your organization's membership on a15k.org.</li>
  <li>From your member screen on a15k.org, get your API tokens.</li>
  <li>Read through the <%= link_to "tech glossary", "#tech_glossary" %> below to get a better idea about the kinds of content the network holds.</li>
  <li>Read through the <%= link_to "example implementation", "#example_implementation" %> and workflows below.</li>
  <li>Visit the <%= link_to "Items", "/items" %> and <%= link_to "Interactions", "/interactions" %> details pages to read the API specs, access client libraries, and learn about more advanced a15k usage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tech Glossary</h2>

<%
@glossary = [
  {
    term: "Member",
    desc: "Normally an organization that has joined the network, though in some cases refers to an individual.  A member has users that act on behalf of the member."
  },
  {
    term: "Assessment",
    desc: "The umbrella for all things related to an exercises that a student could work, including its stem, answer, solutions, and variants"
  },
  {
    term: "Item",
    desc: ""
  },
  {
    term: "Solution",
    desc: ""
  },
  {
    term: "Question",
    desc: ""
  },
  {
    term: "Translator",
    desc: ""
  },
  {
    term: "User",

  },
  {
    term: "Format",
    desc: ""
  },

  {
    term: "...",
    desc: ""
  }

]
%>

<table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <% @glossary.each do |item| %>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><%= item[:term] %></th>
      <td><%= item[:desc] %></td>
    </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="example_implementation">An Example Implementation</h2>

<p>In the following we walk through UML diagrams and sample code for core operations within the network.  More advanced operations are
described on the tech details pages.</p>

<h3>Contributing Items</h3>

<p>The Assessment Network tries to impose as few restrictions as possible on the items contributed by members.  We just need the following:</p>

<p><b>We <i>do not</i> ask you to format your content according to some common schema.<br>
   We <i>do</i> ask that you document whatever format you are using.</b></p>

<p>We recognize that it would be a fool's errand to ask members to all rally around a common assessment format.  Even if such a thing were possible in some cases, members will have unique content that will never losslessly map to a common format.  So we don't even try - we just ask members to give us content in whatever format they have and also to describe that format so that other members can effectively use the content they take from the network.</p>

<p><b>We ask for the assessments to be given individually.</b></p>

<p>If you have 1000 items to contribute, we want them separated out when they arrive at the network (e.g. by calling the API 1000 times or by using a bulk API that accepts an array of assessment items).  We need to be able track and analyze assessments on an individual basis, and since we don't care about the internal format of the content, we don't want to be in a position of having to unpack a blob of 1000 items.</p>

<p><b>We ask for solutions to not be embedded in question content.</b></p>

<p>We want to be able to track and analyze solutions separately from their questions.  As such we need them in isolation and our API has a dedicated spot for them. As stated above, we (as the network) don't want to understand your content format to be able to do that.  Other members may eventually contribute their own solutions to your questions, which is another reason for the network's API to view them as separate entities.</p>
